# How to contribute

The point of GITenberg is to make it easier to access and improve public 
domain books. We _love_ to get contributions, and there are a number of ways 
you can get involved, no matter what your skillset.

If you would like to help, vist the [contributing](http://gutenberg.github.com/contributing.html) page for more information.
